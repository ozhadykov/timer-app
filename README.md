# Time tracker (t-app)

This is a little time tracking app project, beacuse i could not find any solution in in internet, which could fullfill all my needs:), So i realized, i'm a software dev, why should not i learn something new and build the app, to solve my problem and probably, problems of other people

## Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

```bash
quasar dev
```

### Lint the files

```bash
yarn lint
# or
npm run lint
```

### Format the files

```bash
yarn format
# or
npm run format
```

### Build the app for production

```

### Customize the configuration

See [Configuring quasar.config.js](https://v2.quasar.dev/quasar-cli-vite/quasar-config-js).

## Main funtionality

The main feature is to track time. It should be very easy to strat tracking time.
For example you create a new timer, and you can start tracking time, when you click on a preview click button or
If you open a timer and then, you will have a one big button start timer, which will start time tracking.
